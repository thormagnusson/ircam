            <h2>Symposium Theme</h2>

            <p>The New Notations Symposium at IRCAM explores current notational practices in the writing for new instruments and media. The aim is to study the changes in notational strategies that are brought forward with new music technologies, where graphics, animation, and algorithmic techniques offer extended compositional possibilities. Musical notation and instruments evolve in parallel, and we find that in much contemporary work, the notation system becomes part of the instrument, or even an integral part of the musical piece itself. Processor-based media enable dynamic score systems that are applied to generate musical events in real-time or respond to instrumental performances in ways traditional media are not capable of.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, with the increased analytical power gained with machine listening technologies, we find that auxillary notations of timbre, gesture, and affect become important aspects of the "writing" of a musical work. Contemporary composers study this potential of new notation, and this symposium look into the design of new instruments from ergonomic and timbral perspectives and study how musical notation develops in concert with these changes.</p>

            <p>Symposium topics include musical notation for new instruments, secondary notation, graphic or algorithmic notation, live and animated notation, usability, sustainability and legacy, tradition, issues of learning, audience communication, and more. The symposium consists of presentations, performances, and discussions. It is an open event, as long as space is available. For people interested in participating in the symposium, please fill in the registration form below.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Key topics during the day will address different aspects of musical instrumentalities: 

            <li>notation and tradition - how does a notational language evolve? 
            <li>new instruments - how does the role of notation change with new technologies? 
            <li>the symbol and the material - do new ergonomic and timbral affordances require new symbolism? 
            <li>the evolving instrument - how do we compose for evolving technologies? 
            <li>notation in screen-based and computational media - what are the qualities of dynamic scores?
            <li>graphic notation, live notation, animated notation - how does concept of "liveness" change?
            <li>education and learning - how do we learn new notations for new digital instruments? 
            <li>audience understanding - how do we communicate what a notation system does?
            <li>how does a notation system evolve, and how do we understand that evolution? 
            <li>what does a musical notation system mediate?
            </p>

            <h4><b>Till Bovermann: Thoughts on Instrumentality for Sonic Wilderness Interventions</b></h4>

            Music making has a long tradition and so does the selection of places at which music is performed. Over time, such places turned from simple common areas located i.e. in the centre of a settlement to intentionally designed locations such as churches and concert halls that foster sonic qualities by architectural acoustic elements. Sometimes, however, it feels necessary to escape established performance places and enrich soundscapes of areas by music that are not commonly accepted to be environments for music making. Areas that are off-the-grid, wild. This talk examines the nature of such contemporary wilderness performances, touching aspects like composition, the act of playing, the choice of instruments, and the interpretation of the term "performance" itself.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://tai-studio.org">Till Bovermann</a> studied and worked at Bielefeld University where he received a PhD for his work on Tangible Auditory Interfaces.  Later, he worked as a post-doctoral researcher on tangible and auditory interaction at the Media Lab of Aalto University, Finland. Among others, Till has been teaching instrument design and sound technology at various international institutions, among others the IMM in Düsseldorf, at Aalto Universiy and at the institute for time-based media of UdK Berlin. In his artistic works, he often addresses the relationship between seemingly contradictory elements, e.g. the digital and physical realm. Till also develops software in and for SuperCollider and runs TAI-stuido.org. Since 2014, Till is the principal investigator/UdK Berlin of the 3DMIN project on “Design, Development and Dissemination of New Musical Instruments”, a collaboration between UdK Berlin and TU Berlin. <br><br>

            <h4><b>Enrique Tomás: Towards Non-linguistic Writing for Music: A Performative Approach</b></h4>

            In my talk, I will defend that representationalism has a history and that non-linguistic approaches for writing music might be an alternative for music notation. As Derrida states when referring to Pierce's philosophy of notation: “From the moment that there is meaning, there is nothing but signs. We think only in signs”. Our Western traditional music notation, a collection of related symbols with a given and arbitrary meaning, should be understood eminently as a linguistic technology, but more important, decoupled from our cognition of embodied artifacts. As a result, these representational systems are difficult to apply when, for example, our music is created for digital and interactive instruments, or when it incorporates phonetic (non-linguistic) content. I argue that a “performative” understanding of writing music, which shifts the focus from linguistic and visual representations to discursive practices, is one such alternative for suggesting new musical practices of notation.

            <h4><b>Claudia Molitor: A visual moment</b></h4>

            As composers we naturally focus on sound as our main material, yet spend much of our time drawing – drawing notation. Whether with pen and paper or with notational software, we have much common gound with designers and architects at the early stages of our creative process: wrestling an as yet unrealised spatial and temporal idea onto the “two dimensional” space of the page/screen in order to communicate it to the interpreter(s); whether they be makers in the case of design, builders in the case of architecture or performers in the case of music. It is with notation that some composers challenge conventions and beliefs about musical practice; in their work the score becomes both a ‘script’ to be interpreted as well as a conceptual space. It is the demands of the sonic possibilities, technologies or imaginations as well as the notational systems used, which in turn influence the composer’s thinking… a feedback loop between the sonic and the visual.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://www.claudiamolitor.org">Claudia Molitor</a> is a composer/artist whose work draws on traditions of music and sound art but also extends to video, performance and fine art practices. Exploring the relationships between listening and seeing as well as embracing collaboration as compositional practice is central to this work. Her work is regularly commissioned, performed and broadcast throughout Europe. Recent work includes Sonorama with Electra Productions, Turner Contemporary and the British Library, Vast White Stillness for Spitalfields Festival and Brighton Festival, and 2TwoLO for NMC’s ‘Objects of an Exhibition’ project with the Science Museum. She is currently working with MusikFabrik for a piece for hcmf// 2016 and the The Singing Bridge will run over three weeks at Totally Thames this September, with a digital download release on NMC. <br><br>

            <h4><b>Pavlos Antoniadis : Old notation, new interface: embodied navigation of complex piano notation with the GesTCom</b></h4>

            The evolution of traditional notation towards increased specificity and complexity has been expanding its role from the composer’s “brain in a vat” into an elastic interface dynamically amalgamated with instruments and performing bodies. In that sense, a Xenakis or Ferneyhough score is inviting interaction more than interpreta-tion, navigation more than understanding. At the same time, new technologies such as the ones for gesture capture and interactive notation are allowing for the materialisation of metaphors into actual multimodal nota-tions. Along these lines, I will present a model of embodied interaction with complex piano notation (embo-died navigation) and a prototype system for the gestural processing of musical scores (GesTCom -Gesture Cutting through Textual Complexity). The first approaches notation through concepts in the field of embodied cognition, the latter integrates views from NIME and CHI into a gesturally controlled interface for notation processing.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <h4><b>Sally Jane Norman: New Notations and Embodied Experience</b></h4>

            The mechanical vibrations we shape and apprehend as artistic sound lend themselves to potentially infinite kinds of notation. Systems devised to plot, store, and recreate sonic events are more or less context-bound: western classical scores consolidated by centuries of academic practice presume set instrumental and interpretive parameters, while open processes integral to recent electronics and digital techniques require very different compositional and notational approaches. Yet despite the conjoined cognitive and technological evolution associated with the latter practices, our sense of rhythm and scale remains anchored in corporeal morphologies and dynamics, in psychophysiological projections of effort and intentionality into the most ostensibly abstract domains. However strange they may seem, creative acts can only be grasped, thus notated, via our inevitably anthropomorphising sensibility. This presentation emphasises the need to build embodied experience - notably gesture and touch - into new notational strategies.<br>
