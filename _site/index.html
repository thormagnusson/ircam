            <h2>Symposium Theme</h2>

            <p>The New Notations Symposium at IRCAM explores current notational practices in the writing for new instruments and media. The aim is to study the changes in notational strategies that are brought forward with new music technologies, where graphics, animation, and algorithmic techniques offer extended compositional possibilities. Musical notation and instruments evolve in parallel, and we find that in much contemporary work, the notation system becomes part of the instrument, or even an integral part of the musical piece itself. Processor-based media enable dynamic score systems that are applied to generate musical events in real-time or respond to instrumental performances in ways traditional media are not capable of.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, with the increased analytical power gained with machine listening technologies, we find that auxillary notations of timbre, gesture, and affect become important aspects of the "writing" of a musical work. Contemporary composers study this potential of new notation, and this symposium looks into the design of new instruments from ergonomic and timbral perspectives and studies how musical notation develops in concert with these changes.
            </p>

            <p>Symposium topics include musical notation for new instruments, secondary notation, graphic or algorithmic notation, live and animated notation, usability, sustainability and legacy, tradition, issues of learning, audience communication, and more. The symposium consists of presentations, performances, and discussions. It is an open event, as long as space is available. For people interested in participating in the symposium, please fill in the registration form below.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Key topics during the day will address different aspects of musical instrumentalities: 

            <li>notation and tradition - how does a notational language evolve? 
            <li>new instruments - how does the role of notation change with new technologies? 
            <li>the symbol and the material - do new ergonomic and timbral affordances require new symbolism? 
            <li>the evolving instrument - how do we compose for evolving technologies? 
            <li>notation in screen-based and computational media - what are the qualities of dynamic scores?
            <li>graphic notation, live notation, animated notation - how does concept of "liveness" change?
            <li>education and learning - how do we learn new notations for new digital instruments? 
            <li>audience understanding - how do we communicate what a notation system does?
            <li>how does a notation system evolve, and how do we understand that evolution? 
            <li>what does a musical notation system mediate?
            </p>

            <h4><b>Enrique Tomás: Towards Non-linguistic Writing for Music: A Performative Approach</b></h4>

            In my talk, I will defend that representationalism has a history and that non-linguistic approaches for writing music might be an alternative for music notation. As Derrida states when referring to Pierce's philosophy of notation: “From the moment that there is meaning, there is nothing but signs. We think only in signs”. Our Western traditional music notation, a collection of related symbols with a given and arbitrary meaning, should be understood eminently as a linguistic technology, but more important, decoupled from our cognition of embodied artifacts. As a result, these representational systems are difficult to apply when, for example, our music is created for digital and interactive instruments, or when it incorporates phonetic (non-linguistic) content. I argue that a “performative” understanding of writing music, which shifts the focus from linguistic and visual representations to discursive practices, is one such alternative for suggesting new musical practices of notation.

            <h4><b>Frederic Bevilacqua: Perspective on notating and annotating expressive mouvements for interactive systems</b></h4>

            I will present and discuss some current issues on movement notation for interactive systems. The growing use of interactive machine learning with new musical interfaces brings new opportunities for movement notation and annotation. It also poses new difficulties, which interestingly should lead us to question and propose novel notation approaches.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://frederic-bevilacqua.net">Frédéric Bevilacqua</a> is the head of the Sound Music Movement Interaction team at IRCAM in Paris. His research concerns the modeling and the design of interaction between movement and sound, and the development of gesture-based interactive systems. He holds a master degree in physics and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Optics from EPFL in Lausanne. He also studied music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and has participated in different music and media arts projects. From 1999 to 2003 he was a researcher at the Beckman Laser Institute at the University of California Irvine. In 2003 he joined IRCAM as a researcher on gesture analysis for music and performing arts.

            <h4><b>Claudia Molitor: A visual moment</b></h4>

            As composers we naturally focus on sound as our main material, yet spend much of our time drawing – drawing notation. Whether with pen and paper or with notational software, we have much common gound with designers and architects at the early stages of our creative process: wrestling an as yet unrealised spatial and temporal idea onto the “two dimensional” space of the page/screen in order to communicate it to the interpreter(s); whether they be makers in the case of design, builders in the case of architecture or performers in the case of music. It is with notation that some composers challenge conventions and beliefs about musical practice; in their work the score becomes both a ‘script’ to be interpreted as well as a conceptual space. It is the demands of the sonic possibilities, technologies or imaginations as well as the notational systems used, which in turn influence the composer’s thinking… a feedback loop between the sonic and the visual.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://www.claudiamolitor.org">Claudia Molitor</a> is a composer/artist whose work draws on traditions of music and sound art but also extends to video, performance and fine art practices. Exploring the relationships between listening and seeing as well as embracing collaboration as compositional practice is central to this work. Her work is regularly commissioned, performed and broadcast throughout Europe. Recent work includes Sonorama with Electra Productions, Turner Contemporary and the British Library, Vast White Stillness for Spitalfields Festival and Brighton Festival, and 2TwoLO for NMC’s ‘Objects of an Exhibition’ project with the Science Museum. She is currently working with MusikFabrik for a piece for hcmf// 2016 and the The Singing Bridge will run over three weeks at Totally Thames this September, with a digital download release on NMC. <br><br>

            <h4><b>Pavlos Antoniadis : Old notation, new interface: embodied navigation of complex piano notation with the GesTCom</b></h4>

            The evolution of traditional notation towards increased specificity and complexity has been expanding its role from the composer’s “brain in a vat” into an elastic interface dynamically amalgamated with instruments and performing bodies. In that sense, a Xenakis or Ferneyhough score is inviting interaction more than interpreta-tion, navigation more than understanding. At the same time, new technologies such as the ones for gesture capture and interactive notation are allowing for the materialisation of metaphors into actual multimodal nota-tions. Along these lines, I will present a model of embodied interaction with complex piano notation (embo-died navigation) and a prototype system for the gestural processing of musical scores (GesTCom -Gesture Cutting through Textual Complexity). The first approaches notation through concepts in the field of embodied cognition, the latter integrates views from NIME and CHI into a gesturally controlled interface for notation processing.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="https://pavlosantoniadis.wordpress.com/about">Pavlos Antoniadis</a> is a Berlin-based new music pianist & a PhD candidate at Ircam and Labex Gream under the supervision of F. Bevilacqua and P. Michel. He has performed in Europe, the Americas and Asia with Work in Progress-Berlin, KNM, Phorminx, Ergon and as a soloist. He has recorded for Mode (2015 Deutscheschallplat-tenkritikspreis) and Wergo records. He has published on embodied cognition, gesture capture and piano per-formance and has been invited to lecture at institutions such as Goldsmiths London, INMM Darmstadt, Orcim Gent, Ircam Paris, Conservatoire Strasbourg, Aristoteleio Thessaloniki, Hong Kong University. He was a Musical Research Residency fellow at Ircam in 2014.

            <h4><b>Einar Torfi Einarsson: Notation’s struggle to the surface (or, towards concrete notation)</b></h4>

            Notation is a system within a system. It has evolved in between or amidst the composer and the performer/instrument and has had a clear position (composer-score-performer), functionality (communication tool and performer engagement), and directionality (towards performative sonic results). Despite its multifarious paths and appearances it has remained in the background or as a secondary aspect of music (sound being dominant). But could notation denature or leave behind its symbolism, its reference system or its place in the system it evolved within? Does it have an escape route? In this talk I will trace and propose a (im)possible evolution of a strand of notation called prescriptive notation and explore another notational directionality, leading to experimental fusion of material and notation, or something I’m calling concrete notation where notation examines and questions its own functionality and history.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://einartorfieinarsson.com">Einar Torfi Einarsson</a> is a composer and researcher. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Huddersfield where he studied on the Jonathan Harvey Scholarship. His music has been performed throughout Europe by ensembles such as ELISION Ensemble, Klangforum Wien and Ensemble Intercontemporain. His research interests lie in the interplay of poststructuralist philosophy and notation through which he has been developing the notion of decontextualized notation and concrete notation. In 2013-14 he was a post-doc Research Fellow at the Orpheus Institute (ORCiM, Ghent, Belgium). Currently he is a Lecturer in Composition at the Iceland Academy of the Arts.<br><br>

            <h4><b>Franziska Schroeder: The absence of notation - exploring a haptic aurality</b></h4>

            Within such notational possibilities signs are able to formalise, to solidify but also to expand practice. And while the ritual of performance practices in Classical Music might be seen as highly regulated, in which the performer is often posited as a self-effacing, faithful servant to the notated work, there exist certain practices, including free music improvisation, that not only question notation (and much more!) but that revel in the absence of notational signs. Taking as a starting point Jean-Louis Schefer’s idea of a ʻpractice of notationʼ (1995), I want to think of notation as a colouring of signs, rather than an execution of signs, but going further, I will examine the absence of notation in some improvisational practices and argue that an absence of notational concepts allows performers the creative space for turning inward and for straining towards self (Nancy, 2002). I want to consider music practices that question or ignore notational signs as practices that allow for a deeper reverence for musical, cultural and social engagements with others. With the introduction of computer models into free improvisation practices (the use of Probabilistic Graphical Models, such as Bayesian and Markov networks, as explored in Kalonaris in 2016), we see a return to a desire for notational instructions. Such turn towards imposing notational frameworks counters the socio-political spirit of some of the original ideas of what is meant to be ‘free’, while it shifts the musician’s focus towards the visual sign. Where this move towards a more regulated notational framework will lead free improvisers is yet to be seen - it is certainly a journey that some musicians take reluctantly, always in the hope that the notational signs will further expand, rather than solidify, their practice.

            <h4><b>Sally Jane Norman: New Notations and Embodied Experience</b></h4>

            The mechanical vibrations we shape and apprehend as artistic sound lend themselves to potentially infinite kinds of notation. Systems devised to plot, store, and recreate sonic events are more or less context-bound: western classical scores consolidated by centuries of academic practice presume set instrumental and interpretive parameters, while open processes integral to recent electronics and digital techniques require very different compositional and notational approaches. Yet despite the conjoined cognitive and technological evolution associated with the latter practices, our sense of rhythm and scale remains anchored in corporeal morphologies and dynamics, in psychophysiological projections of effort and intentionality into the most ostensibly abstract domains. However strange they may seem, creative acts can only be grasped, thus notated, via our inevitably anthropomorphising sensibility. This presentation emphasises the need to build embodied experience - notably gesture and touch - into new notational strategies.<br>

            <h4><b>Dominique Fober: How technology affects the music score</b></h4>

            New technologies pose new challenges for the music score: interactive music, new instruments, mixed medias, purely gesture based performances, are among the domains explored by the contemporary creation that overflow the classical frame of the music notation. On another other side, new systems for music notation and representation are emerging, adressing these challenges, proposing also new ways to represent the music, exploiting the specific dimensions of digital scores. Dynamicity, interactivity are part of the new dimensions of the music score that lead to new musical forms. I will present and discuss these issues and how they are addressed in my current research.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            Dominique Fober has both a scientific and musical background. He is doing computer music research at Grame - National Center for Music Creation based in Lyon, France - for over 20 years. His research is concerned mainly with software architecture for real-time music systems, languages for musical composition, and music notation and representation systems. He has created, as author or joint author, many musical systems and programs. His most recent work focuses on the extension of the music score, with the aim of covering the needs of the contemporary music creation, as well as  those of technology enhanced music pedagogy.

                <p> <span style="background-color: #242424">IRCAM, the Institute for Research and Coordi- nation in Acoustics/Music, is one of the world’s largest public research centers dedicated to both musical expression and scientific research. A unique location where artistic sensibilities col- lide with scientific and technological innovation, Frank Madlener has directed the institute since 2006, bringing together over 160 people.</span></p>

                <p> <span style="background-color: #242424">IRCAM’s three principal activities — creation, research, transmission — are visible in IRCAM’s Parisian concert season, in productions through- out France and abroad, in a new rendezvous cre- ated in June 2012, ManiFeste, that combines an international festival with a multidisciplinary academy.</span></p>

                <p> <span style="background-color: #242424">Founded by Pierre Boulez, IRCAM is associated with the Centre Pompidou, under the tutelage of the French Ministry of Culture and Communi- cation. The mixed STMS research lab (Sciences and Technologies for Music and Sound), housed by IRCAM, also benefits from the support of the CNRS and the University Pierre and Marie Curie, as well as Inria (team-project MuTant).</span></p>

<br><br><span style="background-color: #242424">Ircam is next to the famous Centre Pompidou and should be easy to find.</span>
