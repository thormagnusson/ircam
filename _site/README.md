## Musical Organics Symposium, 2016 @ STEIM

The Musical Organics symposium at STEIM brings together specialists from diverse disciplines who all engage with the design and performance of new musical instruments. The aim with the one-day symposium is to poke a little into the epistemology of the material objects that musical instruments are and question how musical theory is inscribed in musical technics: equally in acoustic, electric and digital instruments. With traditional instrumental organology being largely the science of instrumental classification and history, this symposium will explore the genealogy of musical instruments as an organic environment where features are borrowed, exchanged, translated and transduced between modalities such as the acoustic, electric, and the digital. Symposium topics range from traditional and new instrument design, musical notation for new instruments, sustainability and legacy, tradition, issues of learning, audience communication, and more.

Amsterdam, May 6th, 2016.

A symposium run as part of the Sonic Writing project.
