            <h2>WORKSHOPS</h2>
            
            <p>We invite composers, performers and improvisers to come and explore and create new works for novel electro-acoustic resonating instruments. The workshops are collaborative, focussing on knowledge exchange between instrument builders, composers and performers; there will be an opportunity to perform new works at the end of the second day. Workshop participants will work with either the <a href="http://www.halldorulfarsson.info/halldorophones/about-halldorophones" target="_blank"> halldorophone</a> or <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/mrp.html" target="_blank">Magnetic Resonator Piano</a>. The Halldorophone is a cello-like electroacoustic instrument affording controlled feedback; the Magnetic Resonator Piano is an electronically-augmented acoustic piano capable of eliciting new sounds acoustically from the piano strings. Both of these instruments are new and unique, but already have an established repertoire and performance history internationally. Workshops will culminate in a performance, but focus heavily on consideration of themes including new instruments, new notation,  interpretation of new works, how to adapt embodied playing techniques of familiar interfaces with new functionality etc.</p>
            
            
            <p>These two-day workshops will be structured such that in the morning of the first day, the inventor will present the instrument, its history and workings. Then participants will be able to explore the instrument. Discussions regarding performance, improvisation and new notation will be chaired by the instrument maker. After lunch, people will work solo or in pairs/groups (e.g., composer-performer duos) on a musical piece which could be notated or of improvisational nature. A regrouping in the evening offers an opportunity to discuss the experiments and successes/failures of the day, leading to a dinner in a restaurant. The next day the workshops will continue in the morning, focussing on practicing and finishing the pieces. In the evening the work will be performed in the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/wcm/assets/media/original/29447.jpg" target="_blank">Attenborough Centre Auditorium</a>. The pieces will be recorded (audio and video) and published online (subject to approval).</p>

            <p>Participating in the workshop will be a cellist (<a href="http://www.ecila.org" target="_blank"> Alice Eldridge</a>) and a pianist (<a href="http://sarahnicolls.com" target="_blank"> Sarah Nicolls</a>) with experience of playing these new instruments. Their presence in the workshops will helpful for both composers and other performers.</p>

            <h4><b>Workshop 1: The halldorophone</b></h4>

            <p>Halldoropohones are electro acoustic string instruments developed by Halldór Úlfarsson. The instrument is cello-like in its configuration but with unique features that define the method of playing and facilitate its unusal timbre. Over the last decade a growing number of composers haved composed by solo and ensemble works for the halldorophone. A seminar on conventions in composing for halldorophone was recently held at the Icelandic Academy of Arts, Music department with a panel of composers who have worked with the instrument in recent years.</p>

            <br><b>Workshop leader: Halldór Úlfarsson:</b><br>

            <p>Halldór Úlfarsson is an artist and designer based in Iceland. His practice primarily involves developing projects and collaborations around his electro acoustic string instrument the halldorophone which he has been developing for about a decade. Halldór has a degree from the Finnish Academy of Fine Art and an MA in design from TAIK (Helsinki). He currently works for the department of design at the Icelandic Academy of the Arts.</p>

            <h4><b>Workshop 2: The Magnetic Resonator Piano</b></h4>

            <p>The magnetic resonator piano (MRP) is an electronically augmented acoustic piano. Electromagnets are placed inside a grand piano which induce the strings to vibrate independently of the hammers, allowing the performer to create notes with infinite sustain, crescendos from silence, pitch bends, harmonics and new timbres. It is played from the piano keyboard using a scanner that measures the continuous position of each key. Over 20 pieces have been composed for MRP, including recent projects with People Inside Electronics (Los Angeles), the London Chamber Orchestra and the band These New Puritans.</p>

            <br><b>Workshop leader: Andrew McPherson:</b><br>

            <p>Andrew McPherson is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London. A composer and electrical engineer by training, he studied at MIT (M.Eng. 2005) and the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D. 2009) and spent a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Drexel University. His research focuses on augmented instruments, embedded hardware systems, the study of performer-instrument interaction and user appropriation of technology. In addition to the MRP, he is the creator of the TouchKeys, a multi-touch-sensing keyboard which successfully launched on Kickstarter in 2013.</p>
