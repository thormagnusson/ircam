            <h4><b>Enrique Tomás: Towards Non-linguistic Writing for Music: A Performative Approach</b></h4>

            In my talk, I will defend that representationalism has a history and that non-linguistic approaches for writing music might be an alternative for music notation. As Derrida states when referring to Pierce's philosophy of notation: “From the moment that there is meaning, there is nothing but signs. We think only in signs”. Our Western traditional music notation, a collection of related symbols with a given and arbitrary meaning, should be understood eminently as a linguistic technology, but more important, decoupled from our cognition of embodied artifacts. As a result, these representational systems are difficult to apply when, for example, our music is created for digital and interactive instruments, or when it incorporates phonetic (non-linguistic) content. I argue that a “performative” understanding of writing music, which shifts the focus from linguistic and visual representations to discursive practices, is one such alternative for suggesting new musical practices of notation.

            <h4><b>Claudia Molitor: A visual moment</b></h4>

            As composers we naturally focus on sound as our main material, yet spend much of our time drawing – drawing notation. Whether with pen and paper or with notational software, we have much common gound with designers and architects at the early stages of our creative process: wrestling an as yet unrealised spatial and temporal idea onto the “two dimensional” space of the page/screen in order to communicate it to the interpreter(s); whether they be makers in the case of design, builders in the case of architecture or performers in the case of music. It is with notation that some composers challenge conventions and beliefs about musical practice; in their work the score becomes both a ‘script’ to be interpreted as well as a conceptual space. It is the demands of the sonic possibilities, technologies or imaginations as well as the notational systems used, which in turn influence the composer’s thinking… a feedback loop between the sonic and the visual.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://www.claudiamolitor.org">Claudia Molitor</a> is a composer/artist whose work draws on traditions of music and sound art but also extends to video, performance and fine art practices. Exploring the relationships between listening and seeing as well as embracing collaboration as compositional practice is central to this work. Her work is regularly commissioned, performed and broadcast throughout Europe. Recent work includes Sonorama with Electra Productions, Turner Contemporary and the British Library, Vast White Stillness for Spitalfields Festival and Brighton Festival, and 2TwoLO for NMC’s ‘Objects of an Exhibition’ project with the Science Museum. She is currently working with MusikFabrik for a piece for hcmf// 2016 and The Singing Bridge will run over three weeks at Totally Thames this September, with a digital download release on NMC. <br><br>

            <h4><b>Frederic Bevilacqua: Perspective on notating and annotating expressive mouvements for interactive systems</b></h4>

            I will present and discuss some current issues on movement notation for interactive systems. The growing use of interactive machine learning with new musical interfaces brings new opportunities for movement notation and annotation. It also poses new difficulties, which interestingly should lead us to question and propose novel notation approaches.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://frederic-bevilacqua.net">Frédéric Bevilacqua</a> is the head of the Sound Music Movement Interaction team at IRCAM in Paris. His research concerns the modeling and the design of interaction between movement and sound, and the development of gesture-based interactive systems. He holds a master degree in physics and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Optics from EPFL in Lausanne. He also studied music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and has participated in different music and media arts projects.

            <h4><b>Frances-Marie Uitti: Signs and Symbols for a New Music</b></h4>

            Designing a comprehensive notation for a new musical technology:  in particular the challenge of notation for a new musical gesture controller that supports conventional and extended two-bow cello playing with the unusual feature that it has no strings. Given the unique problems inherent with a huge flow of musical data, separating the various complexities into manageable and readable format, I am approaching musical notation as a fluid and fluent set of flowing systems that is constantly changing according to the needs of each musical situation or composition. 
            <br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://www.uitti.org">Frances-Marie Uitti</a>, composer/performer, pioneered a revolutionary dimension to the cello by transforming it for the first time into a polyphonic instrument capable of sustained chordal (two, three, and four-part) and intricate multivoiced writing. Using two bows in one hand, this invention permits contemporaneous cross accents, multiple timbres, contrasting 4-voiced dynamics, simultaneous legato vs articulated playing. György Kurtág, Luigi Nono, Giacinto Scelsi, Jonathan Harvey, Richard Barrett, Horatio Radulescu, Lisa Bielawa are among many who have used this technique in their works dedicated to her.

            <h4><b>Jonathan Impett: Untitled</b></h4>

            The technologies – codes and materials – of inscription play a vital role in forming musical objects and practices, and crucially inform the discourses of music. Many current issues can be traced back to the beginning of the C20th, to the beginning of what has been described in architecture as an ‘age of divided representation’. An extraordinary property of common Western music notation has been its multiple functions: manipulation, representation, description, instruction and analysis for the same musical material can all be carried out using the same notational system. As with literacy, Western notation thus entered the cognitive processes associated with music, even in the absence of material text. Notation continues to inform musical thought, at all stages of a work’s existence. However, we cannot assume the same multivalency. In considering notational practices for the creation and performance of today’s hybrid musical objects, we must re-evaluate its role. Conventional assumptions are challenged by actual practice. Notation may best be viewed as a technology, and a crucial node in a network of technologies among which we must count human technical skills. Notation is a central node in the unique  pattern of determination, distribution and dissemination that characterizes each musical object.  <br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://www.orpheusinstituut.be/en/persons/jonathan-impett">Jonathan Impett</a> studied at the University of London, City University, Royal Academy of Music , Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, and University of Cambridge. He is Director of Research at the Orpheus Institute, Ghent and Associate Professor at Middlesex University, London. His compositions explore the spaces between score and improvisation, most recently using prepared acoustics and wave phenomena as a way of integrating symbolic-compositional, sound processing and improvisational materials. Early work with the computer-extended metatrumpet has led to a continuing engagement with interactive technologies and the acts and contexts of performance. As a trumpet player he has given premieres of solo works by composers including Berio, Harvey and Scelsi, as well as performing with ensembles such as London Sinfonietta and Apartment House and in various improvisational contexts. He is also a member of The Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century and The Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra. His research is also concerned with the discourses and practices of contemporary musical creativity, particularly the nature of the contemporary technologically-situated musical artefact: ‘The work without content’. A monograph on the music of Luigi Nono will appear in 2017. He leads a new research cluster at the Orpheus Institute, 'Music, Thought and Technology’, taking a critical technical practice approach to understanding musical creativity.<br><br>

            <h4><b>Franziska Schroeder: The absence of notation - exploring a haptic aurality</b></h4>

            Notation marks and explains, it communicates and documents, it prescribes and produces. Within such notational possibilities signs are able to formalise, to solidify but also to expand practice.  And while the ritual of performance practices in Classical Music might be seen as highly regulated, in which the performer is often posited as a self-effacing, faithful servant to the notated work, there exist certain practices, including free music improvisation, that not only question notation (and much more!) but that revel in the absence of notational signs. Taking as a starting point Jean-Louis Schefer’s idea of a ʻpractice of notationʼ (1995), I want to think of notation as a colouring of signs, rather than an execution of signs, but going further, I will examine the absence of notation in some improvisational practices and argue that an absence of notational concepts allows performers the creative space for turning inward and for straining towards self (Nancy, 2002). This turning inward becomes a highly intimate, tactile or haptic listening space (examined as haptic aurality in Schroeder, 2009) that not only involves constructing and consolidating the self, urging the performer to be in a constant state of being on the ‘lookout for a relation to self’, it also allows the performer in rejoicing in her body, in noticing her presence and in being self preoccupied in a very tangible relation with her tools. Since I understand free improvisational practices as creative and social exchanges between musicians anchored in high levels of trust, I want to consider music practices that question or ignore notational signs as practices that allow for a deeper reverence for musical, cultural and social engagements with others. With the introduction of computer models into free improvisation practices (the use of Probabilistic Graphical Models, such as Bayesian and Markov networks, as explored in Kalonaris in 2016), we see a return to a desire for notational instructions. Such turn towards imposing notational frameworks counters the socio-political spirit of some of the original ideas of what is meant to be ‘free’, while it shifts the musician’s focus towards the visual sign. Where this move towards a more regulated notational framework will lead free improvisers is yet to be seen - it is certainly a journey that some musicians take reluctantly, always in the hope that the notational signs will further expand, rather than solidify, their practice.

            <h4><b>Sally Jane Norman: New Notations and Embodied Experience</b></h4>

            The mechanical vibrations we shape and apprehend as artistic sound lend themselves to potentially infinite kinds of notation. Systems devised to plot, store, and recreate sonic events are more or less context-bound: western classical scores consolidated by centuries of academic practice presume set instrumental and interpretive parameters, while open processes integral to recent electronics and digital techniques require very different compositional and notational approaches. Yet despite the conjoined cognitive and technological evolution associated with the latter practices, our sense of rhythm and scale remains anchored in corporeal morphologies and dynamics, in psychophysiological projections of effort and intentionality into the most ostensibly abstract domains. However strange they may seem, creative acts can only be grasped, thus notated, via our inevitably anthropomorphising sensibility. This presentation emphasises the need to build embodied experience - notably gesture and touch - into new notational strategies.<br>

            <h4><b>Pavlos Antoniadis : Old notation, new interface: embodied navigation of complex piano notation with the GesTCom</b></h4>

            The evolution of traditional notation towards increased specificity and complexity has been expanding its role from the composer’s “brain in a vat” into an elastic interface dynamically amalgamated with instruments and performing bodies. In that sense, a Xenakis or Ferneyhough score is inviting interaction more than interpreta-tion, navigation more than understanding. At the same time, new technologies such as the ones for gesture capture and interactive notation are allowing for the materialisation of metaphors into actual multimodal notations. Along these lines, I will present a model of embodied interaction with complex piano notation (embodied navigation) and a prototype system for the gestural processing of musical scores (GesTCom -Gesture Cutting through Textual Complexity). The first approaches notation through concepts in the field of embodied cognition, the latter integrates views from NIME and CHI into a gesturally controlled interface for notation processing.<br>

            <h4><b>Einar Torfi Einarsson: Notation’s struggle to the surface (or, towards concrete notation)</b></h4>

            Notation is a system within a system. It has evolved in between or amidst the composer and the performer/instrument and has had a clear position (composer-score-performer), functionality (communication tool and performer engagement), and directionality (towards performative sonic results). Despite its multifarious paths and appearances it has remained in the background or as a secondary aspect of music (sound being dominant). But could notation denature or leave behind its symbolism, its reference system or its place in the system it evolved within? Does it have an escape route? In this talk I will trace and propose a (im)possible evolution of a strand of notation called prescriptive notation and explore another notational directionality, leading to experimental fusion of material and notation, or something I’m calling concrete notation where notation examines and questions its own functionality and history.<br>

            <h4><b>Ryan Ross Smith: The Trappings of Choice: Mediating the Democratization of Participation through Control</b></h4>

            The development, formalization, codification, and maintenance of common practice notation [CPN] demonstrates a parallel yet intertwined tract to the evolution of musical thought and practice, and while CPN is not the only Western notational approach in existence, it is dominant. Following in line with the various revisions to and extensions of CPN, a new form of niche-notation has been increasing in visibility over the last 15 years: Animated Music Notation [AMN]. Certain trends in contemporary animated scoring practices demonstrate a dismantling of the normative expectations of the score-performer relationship. Namely, that choice, and its trappings (the interpretive expectations placed on performers for example), are discarded in favor of control structures that democratize musical participation, while encouraging, if not requiring, a curiously submissive relationship to the score’s ephemeral dominance. Furthermore, these methods of representation tend to encourage certain compositional ideals beyond those embedded within traditionally-dominant notational models.

            <h4><b>Dominique Fober: How technology affects the music score</b></h4>

            New technologies pose new challenges for the music score: interactive music, new instruments, mixed medias, purely gesture based performances, are among the domains explored by the contemporary creation that overflow the classical frame of the music notation. On another other side, new systems for music notation and representation are emerging, adressing these challenges, proposing also new ways to represent the music, exploiting the specific dimensions of digital scores. Dynamicity, interactivity are part of the new dimensions of the music score that lead to new musical forms. I will present and discuss these issues and how they are addressed in my current research.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            Dominique Fober has both a scientific and musical background. He is doing computer music research at Grame - National Center for Music Creation based in Lyon, France - for over 20 years. His research is concerned mainly with software architecture for real-time music systems, languages for musical composition, and music notation and representation systems. He has created, as author or joint author, many musical systems and programs. His most recent work focuses on the extension of the music score, with the aim of covering the needs of the contemporary music creation, as well as  those of technology enhanced music pedagogy.

            Live coding has been defined as a new path in the evolution of the musical score. Live coding practice accentuates the score, and whilst it is the perfect vehicle for the performance of algorithmic music, it also transforms the compositional process itself into a live event. As a continuation of 20th Century artistic developments of the musical score, live coding systems often embrace graphical elements and language syntaxes foreign to standard programming languages. This talk will presents live coding as a highly technologized artistic practice, shedding light on how non-linearity, play and generativity are prominent in live coding performance practice.
