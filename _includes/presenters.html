            <h4><b>Enrique Tomás: Towards Non-linguistic Writing for Music: A Performative Approach</b></h4>

            In my talk, I will defend that representationalism has a history and that non-linguistic approaches for writing music might be an alternative for music notation. As Derrida states when referring to Pierce's philosophy of notation: “From the moment that there is meaning, there is nothing but signs. We think only in signs”. Our Western traditional music notation, a collection of related symbols with a given and arbitrary meaning, should be understood eminently as a linguistic technology, but more important, decoupled from our cognition of embodied artifacts. As a result, these representational systems are difficult to apply when, for example, our music is created for digital and interactive instruments, or when it incorporates phonetic (non-linguistic) content. I argue that a “performative” understanding of writing music, which shifts the focus from linguistic and visual representations to discursive practices, is one such alternative for suggesting new musical practices of notation.

            <h4><b>Claudia Molitor: A visual moment</b></h4>

            As composers we naturally focus on sound as our main material, yet spend much of our time drawing – drawing notation. Whether with pen and paper or with notational software, we have much common gound with designers and architects at the early stages of our creative process: wrestling an as yet unrealised spatial and temporal idea onto the “two dimensional” space of the page/screen in order to communicate it to the interpreter(s); whether they be makers in the case of design, builders in the case of architecture or performers in the case of music. It is with notation that some composers challenge conventions and beliefs about musical practice; in their work the score becomes both a ‘script’ to be interpreted as well as a conceptual space. It is the demands of the sonic possibilities, technologies or imaginations as well as the notational systems used, which in turn influence the composer’s thinking… a feedback loop between the sonic and the visual.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://www.claudiamolitor.org">Claudia Molitor</a> is a composer/artist whose work draws on traditions of music and sound art but also extends to video, performance and fine art practices. Exploring the relationships between listening and seeing as well as embracing collaboration as compositional practice is central to this work. Her work is regularly commissioned, performed and broadcast throughout Europe. Recent work includes Sonorama with Electra Productions, Turner Contemporary and the British Library, Vast White Stillness for Spitalfields Festival and Brighton Festival, and 2TwoLO for NMC’s ‘Objects of an Exhibition’ project with the Science Museum. She is currently working with MusikFabrik for a piece for hcmf// 2016 and the The Singing Bridge will run over three weeks at Totally Thames this September, with a digital download release on NMC. <br><br>

            <h4><b>Pavlos Antoniadis : Old notation, new interface: embodied navigation of complex piano notation with the GesTCom</b></h4>

            The evolution of traditional notation towards increased specificity and complexity has been expanding its role from the composer’s “brain in a vat” into an elastic interface dynamically amalgamated with instruments and performing bodies. In that sense, a Xenakis or Ferneyhough score is inviting interaction more than interpreta-tion, navigation more than understanding. At the same time, new technologies such as the ones for gesture capture and interactive notation are allowing for the materialisation of metaphors into actual multimodal nota-tions. Along these lines, I will present a model of embodied interaction with complex piano notation (embo-died navigation) and a prototype system for the gestural processing of musical scores (GesTCom -Gesture Cutting through Textual Complexity). The first approaches notation through concepts in the field of embodied cognition, the latter integrates views from NIME and CHI into a gesturally controlled interface for notation processing.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="https://pavlosantoniadis.wordpress.com/about">Pavlos Antoniadis</a> is a Berlin-based new music pianist & a PhD candidate at Ircam and Labex Gream under the supervision of F. Bevilacqua and P. Michel. He has performed in Europe, the Americas and Asia with Work in Progress-Berlin, KNM, Phorminx, Ergon and as a soloist. He has recorded for Mode (2015 Deutscheschallplat-tenkritikspreis) and Wergo records. He has published on embodied cognition, gesture capture and piano per-formance and has been invited to lecture at institutions such as Goldsmiths London, INMM Darmstadt, Orcim Gent, Ircam Paris, Conservatoire Strasbourg, Aristoteleio Thessaloniki, Hong Kong University. He was a Musical Research Residency fellow at Ircam in 2014. Pavlos holds degrees in piano performance (MA, UC San Diego) and musicology (Athens National University) and has studied on Gream, Fulbright, Ucsd, Nakas, IEMA Frankfurt and Impuls Academy Gratz scholarships.<br><br>

            <h4><b>Einar Torfi Einarsson: Notation’s struggle to the surface (or, towards concrete notation)</b></h4>

            Notation is a system within a system. It has evolved in between or amidst the composer and the performer/instrument and has had a clear position (composer-score-performer), functionality (communication tool and performer engagement), and directionality (towards performative sonic results). Despite its multifarious paths and appearances it has remained in the background or as a secondary aspect of music (sound being dominant). But could notation denature or leave behind its symbolism, its reference system or its place in the system it evolved within? Does it have an escape route? In this talk I will trace and propose a (im)possible evolution of a strand of notation called prescriptive notation and explore another notational directionality, leading to experimental fusion of material and notation, or something I’m calling concrete notation where notation examines and questions its own functionality and history.<br>

            <br><b>Biography</b><br>

            <a href="http://einartorfieinarsson.com">Einar Torfi Einarsson</a> is a composer and researcher. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Huddersfield where he studied on the Jonathan Harvey Scholarship. His music has been performed throughout Europe by ensembles such as ELISION Ensemble, Klangforum Wien and Ensemble Intercontemporain. His research interests lie in the interplay of poststructuralist philosophy and notation through which he has been developing the notion of decontextualized notation and concrete notation. In 2013-14 he was a post-doc Research Fellow at the Orpheus Institute (ORCiM, Ghent, Belgium). Currently he is a Lecturer in Composition at the Iceland Academy of the Arts.<br><br>

            <h4><b>Sally Jane Norman: New Notations and Embodied Experience</b></h4>

            The mechanical vibrations we shape and apprehend as artistic sound lend themselves to potentially infinite kinds of notation. Systems devised to plot, store, and recreate sonic events are more or less context-bound: western classical scores consolidated by centuries of academic practice presume set instrumental and interpretive parameters, while open processes integral to recent electronics and digital techniques require very different compositional and notational approaches. Yet despite the conjoined cognitive and technological evolution associated with the latter practices, our sense of rhythm and scale remains anchored in corporeal morphologies and dynamics, in psychophysiological projections of effort and intentionality into the most ostensibly abstract domains. However strange they may seem, creative acts can only be grasped, thus notated, via our inevitably anthropomorphising sensibility. This presentation emphasises the need to build embodied experience - notably gesture and touch - into new notational strategies.<br>
